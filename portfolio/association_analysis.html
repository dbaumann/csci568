  <h2>Association Analysis</h2>
  <p class="introduction">Association analysis results in the discovery of specific patterns in categorical datasets. In this context, the objects from the dataset are known as transactions. Each transaction is thought of as containing two or more items which can themselves be composed into itemsets. Much of the terminology used is a product of the primary application of association analysis: market basket research, which is devoted to helping retailers understand the purchase behavior of buyers [1]. This technique is also currently being used to understand complex interactions in Earth's global climate system [2]</p>
  
   <p class="introduction">Association rules are expressed in the form $X\rightarrow Y$, where $X$ (the antecedent) and $Y$ (the consequent) are disjoint itemsets. These rules are different from those generated by rule based classifiers, as they imply a correlation between attribute values rather than a rule for predicting the presence of a class label. More specifically, good association rules identify correlations that are both frequent and reliable in a given set of transactions. These properties are quantified with the metrics of support and confidence, respectively:</p>

   <p class="equation">
    $$support(X\rightarrow Y)=\frac{\sigma(X\cup Y)}{N}$$
    $$confidence(X\rightarrow Y)=\frac{\sigma(X\cup Y)}{\sigma(X)}$$
    $\sigma(X)$: The support count of $X$, which is the number of transactions containing itemset $X$ that appear in the total set of transactions $T$<br/>
    $N$: The total number of transactions in $T$
   </p>

   <p>Association analysis consists of two principle tasks: frequent itemset generation and rule generation. Together they result in a set of association rules that meet minimum thresholds for support and confidence.</p>

   <h3>Frequent Itemset Generation</h3>
   <p>The first step in generating good association rules is to identify itemsets meeting the minimum support threshold, from which rules can be constructed. As it is prohibitively expensive to attempt to count the support of all $3^N-2^{N+1}+1$ potential itemsets, a pruning strategy is in order. Fortunately there is a principle on which this can be based.</p>

   <h4>The Apriori Principle</h4>
   <blockquote>If an itemset is infrequent, then all of its supersets must also be infrequent.</blockquote>

   <p>The generation of the set of all frequent itemsets $\bigcup_kF_k$ proceeds as follows. First, the set of frequent 1-itemsets $F_1$ is generated by counting the support of every 1-itemset that appears in $T$. This provides a basis for growing new, larger candidate itemsets which are pruned using the Apriori principle prior to support counting.</p>

   <p>The process of determining good candidate k-itemsets from the set of ($k$-1)-itemsets is the heart of the algorithm. One approach, known as the $F_{k-1}\times F_1$ method, extends each frequent ($k$-1)-itemset with each of the frequent 1-itemsets; this technique is simple but produces a large number of unnecessary candidates. A better choice is the $F_{k-1}\times F_{k-1}$ method. This procedure depends on the ($k$-1)-itemsets being lexicographically ordered, and forms new $k$-itemsets by merging frequent ($k$-1)-itemsets only if their first $k$-2 items are identical.</p>

   <p>Once the set of candidate $k$-itemsets have been generated, each is evaluated to determine if it appears in any of the transactions of $T$. If so, its support is counted and it is added to the set of frequent $k$-itemsets $F_k$ if it meets the minimum support threshold. Once all candidate $k$-itemsets have been considered, the loop will continue with the next value of k of $F_k$ is non-empty. Otherwise, the loop terminates and $\bigcup_kF_k$ is returned.

   <h3>Rule Generation</h3>
   <p>This step is relatively simple in comparison to itemset generation. Each frequent itemset which can be used to generate an association rule is subdivided into two sets, $X$ (which contains all but one item from $Y$) and $Y-X$. These sets are used to form the candidate rule $X\rightarrow Y-X$. Next, the confidence of this rule is calculated. If the candidate rule does not meet the minimum confidence threshold, the itemset is discarded. We can be sure at this point that no valid rules can be extracted from the itemset because of the following theorem:</p>

   <blockquote>If a rule $X\rightarrow Y-X$ does not satisfy a confidence threshold, then any rule $X'\rightarrow Y-X'$, where $X'\subseteq X$, must not satisfy the confidence threshold as well.</blockquote>

   <p>If the candidate rule does meet the minimum confidence threshold, it is output as a new association rule. A new candidate rule is then generated from the same frequent itemset: $X'\rightarrow Y-X'$, where $X'$ has one less item in it than $X$. The process of candidate rule evaluation repeats as before until the support threshold is no longer satisfied.</p>

   <p>Without adequately high support and confidence thresholds, this algorithm can become computationally expensive and produce many spurious rules. Performance can also be affected by large transaction sets and attempting to associate too many items at once; therefore, preprocessing with aggregation and feature subset selection is a crucial part of association analysis.</p>
