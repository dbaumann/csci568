Project 7

Implement a multilayer perceptron network with a single hidden layer consisting of two hidden nodes. The network should be trained with the following example only:
(1, 0.25, 0.25) --> (1, -1, 0)

Files:

main.py:        driver file
network.py:     network abstraction; encapsulates layers and weights
layer.py:       iterable random access container for nodes
node.py:        a representation of a neuron which can be "activated"
